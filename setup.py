This little package applies the law of sines or cosines to find all the
sides and angles of a triangle, if you know some of the sides and/or
angles.

The main function defined by this package is solve(...). Simple example::

    from math import pi
    from trianglesolver import solve
    a,b,c,A,B,C = solve(b=7.6, c=8.3, A=pi/3)

Following the usual convention, lower-case letters are side lengths and
capital letters are angles. Corresponding letters are opposite each other,
e.g. side b is opposite angle B.

All angles are in radians! However, you can use the degree constant to
convert::

    from trianglesolver import solve, degree
    a,b,c,A,B,C = solve(b=7, A=5*degree, B=70*degree)
    print(C / degree)
